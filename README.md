# DebianDog-Wheezy

DebianDog-Wheezy Jwm version development continues here.

I plan to make some changes to make the system more responsive on very old computers and I will try to change the endless bugs fixing method used to the moment with bugs prevention method in next iso update. Starting with Wheezy first if it works well the same changes will be made also in MintPup and in all DebianDog versions mainatined by me in the future.
Till then you can download the latest available DebianDog-Wheezy Jwm iso version here:
