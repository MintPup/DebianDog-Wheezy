Reading the posts after closing [DebianDog-Jessie thread](http://murga-linux.com/puppy/viewtopic.php?p=926138#926138) I don't feel I like to share or contribute anything.

Most of the deleted [DebianDog-Jessie](http://murga-linux.com/puppy/viewtopic.php?p=926601&sid=56dd49007ea414e6eeb5fba021fd2291#926601) forum thread pages uploaded [in this folder for reference.](https://github.com/MintPup/DebianDog-Wheezy/blob/master/deleted-pages/)

To the people posting there:

I wish you were in my shoes, so that one day you would be able to understand what I feel posting this below.

**This project has been discontinued.**

I will keep this repository for reference and because of the fixes for NTFS partition in live-boot in memory of [Nooby](http://murga-linux.com/puppy/viewtopic.php?p=926247#926247):

[Support for live-rw save file on NTFS partition.](https://github.com/MintPup/DebianDog-Wheezy/commit/a9d2875fffda59f81940629fb9825b93a599779e)

[Support for persistence file on NTFS partition.](https://github.com/MintPup/DebianDog-Wheezy/commit/e2eb061df78b96429ac0c2f2d7740f05216d6748)

Life is strange with its twists and turns. Sometimes when people you trust betray you the only support you get comes from unexpected person. And I must admit I was quite rude to this person few times in the past. Sorry about that and thank you **anikin**.


I did what I can to solve the DebianDog project [development problems](http://murga-linux.com/puppy/viewtopic.php?p=946902&sid=04cf5f681d684e12653ecb88ac0cb868#946902).

At last all DebianDog and all based on it projects are free to modify and develop from anyone.

Goodbye.
