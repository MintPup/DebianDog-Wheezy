Seems all posts from **fredx181** and **mcewanw** (my fellow linux developers) in DebianDog-Jessie thread are deleted. Usual practice after stealing a project.

Most of the deleted [DebianDog-Jessie](http://murga-linux.com/puppy/viewtopic.php?p=926601&sid=56dd49007ea414e6eeb5fba021fd2291#926601) forum thread pages uploaded in this folder for reference.
